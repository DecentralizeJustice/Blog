const paragraph3 =
`<p>This is your intro to crypto. You just want to play around with it and maybe buy something. You should use whatever device with an app that you have. Phones are the best. Computers are ok. Whatever you do at this point, store your own crypto with an app on your device. Do not store your crypto on an exchange or online wallet. Software alone isnâ€™t that secure. Until you upgrade to the next tier, software on your phone or computer is the best that you have.
