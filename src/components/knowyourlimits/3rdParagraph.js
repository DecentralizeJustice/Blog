`<p>Alright I saw an crypto clock online and I want to buy it with crypto. This isn’t really play money any more since I would be mad if I lost my money and couldn’t get the clock. For making small purchases you should upgrade to a dedicated desktop or phone app. A phone app is prefered to a desktop app but just use whichever you have. Don’t buy anything yet. For me this amount is around 50 to 200.
