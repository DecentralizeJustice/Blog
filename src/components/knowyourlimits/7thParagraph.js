`<p>These different levels of crypto are reasonable limits that help you keep all of your crypto. They don’t guarantee that you won’t lose your crypto, but they greatly lower that risk. Below is a tool that gives you info about each tier and what tools to use. Just type in the amount of crypto that you want to store and the tool will tell you how you should store your crypto. I will keep this info updated.
