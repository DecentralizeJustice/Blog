  You just heard about crypto and you want to just play with some. So you go and buy
  some from an exchange and maybe donate it to someone or something.
  Congratulations you are a part of the revolution.  You can use coinbase,
  an exchange, or a web wallet for play money. Play money is money that you
  don’t mind losing. For me this would be around 40 bucks. If I lose 40 bucks
  playing around I just budget it as an entertainment cost and move on. But
  anything more than 40 bucks and it’s no longer play money for me.  </p>`
