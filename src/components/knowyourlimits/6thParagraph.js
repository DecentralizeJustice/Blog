`<p>This step is for committed crypto users only. With multisig technology you greatly decrease your threat to online/remote hacks. The biggest threat comes from you losing your crypto to a natural disaster such as a flood or hurricane. In order to decrease the chances of mother nature destroying your crypto holdings you have to distribute your hardware wallet keys. You can have some of your hardware wallet keys with a friend and some at  a bank. Your goal at this tier is to make sure that if a natural disaster hit your house or city you would not lose all of your crypto. This also a good tier to really think about what will happen to your crypto when you pass away. You can leave some hardware wallet keys with a lawyer and some with family members. Your options are limitless at this tier.
