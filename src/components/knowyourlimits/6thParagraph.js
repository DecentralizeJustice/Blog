`<p>Alright Itâ€™s time to bring out the best security that crypto has to offer, Multisig technology. Multisig technology with hardware wallets is where you use several hardware wallets to store your crypto. This allows one hardware wallet to malfunction or be hacked and your crypto will still be safe. There are so many options for multisig, like casa or electrim, but you should use hardware wallet only options and pick a good multisig setup like 2 of 3 or 3 of 5. If this sounds like mumbo jumbo thats ok, my upcoming wallet will make it easy to use. You can use one of the many guides or products in the meantime though. </p>
