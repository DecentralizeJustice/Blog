`<p>Alright we have enough for a hardware wallet. These devices are a breakthrough in applied cryptography. They are cheap and dedicated security computers that only cost 40 dollars.  Hardware wallets are a game changer in trying to invest in our crypto security. Although they arenâ€™t hack proof, they dramatically decrease the attack surface of our crypto. The tier before this allowed remote attackers to steal money, which is the worst case scenario in security; Any hacker with time and an internet connection could hack us. With a hardware wallet we limit our attack surface to in person attacks, and phishing attacks. Hardware wallets are not perfect. The wallet maker could sabotage the wallet, there could be supply chain attacks, and the end user can still be phished. A phishing attack could be an attacker tricking the user to send their address or to give away a wallet mnemonic. They can also be hacked if a theft has access to your physical location, but nothing short of a full time security staff can protect you from in person attacks. In order to make up for some of the shortcomings of a single hardware wallet we can combine them in a multisig arrangement.
