`<p>Alright we have enough for a hardware wallet. These devices are a breakthrough in applied cryptography. 
They are cheap and dedicated security computers that only cost 40 dollars.  
Hardware wallets are a game changer in trying to invest in our crypto security. 
Although they arenâ€™t hack proof, they dramatically decrease the attack surface of our crypto. 
The tier before this allowed remote attackers to steal money, which is the worst case scenario in security; 
Any hacker with time and an internet connection could hack us. With a hardware wallet we limit our attack surface to in person attacks, and social engineering attacks. 
Hardware wallets are not perfect. The wallet maker could sabotage the wallet, there could be supply chain attacks, and the end user can still be phished. 
A social engineering attack could be an attacker tricking the user to send their address or to give away a wallet mnemonic. 
Hardware Wallets can also be hacked if a theif has access to your physical location, but nothing short of a full time security staff can protect you from in person attacks. 
Although hardware wallets can suffer from

There has not been any documented cases of these attacks being used to steal customer funds.
In order to make up for some of the shortcomings of using a single hardware wallet, although their risk might be small currenlty, we can combine multiple wallets in a multisig arrangement.
