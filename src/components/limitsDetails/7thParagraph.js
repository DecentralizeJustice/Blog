`<p>Don’t try and do anything fancy and complicated. A lot of money has been and will be lost to people running custom security setups that they mess up. Building a secure system is hard. 
You have to design, implement, and  practice is perfectly and any mistake can cost you all of our crypto. 
The risk level is an unknown unknown for most people and is not worth it. 
Don’t be that person who thought they were so clever and ends up making sure nobody, even them, can access their crypto.

No paper wallets in 2020, Hardware wallets are now 40 bucks. Hardware wallets are cheaper than most printers, and they cover the full life cycle of your crypto keys. 
They help you keep your crypto keys off

by handling all the signing and processing of your crypto keys on the device itself, unlike a paper wallet.

I wish we had more data to base the guidelines off. They are currently based on keeping a 10% to 30% security ratio but it would be better to 
base it off of data from actual hacks. If we had an omniscient source of data we could assess the chances of each setup getting hack and how much money places you at risk.
We don't have this data though and due to the distributed and private nature of crypto storage I am unsure if we will have access to this kind of data. So currently the best way to
put a number to any guidelines is the one we are currently using.
