`<p>Don’t try and do anything fancy and complicated. A lot of money has been and will be lost to people running custom security setups that they mess up implementing, or have issues in the recovery methods. Don’t be that person who thought they were so clever and ends up making sure nobody, even them, can access their crypto.

No paper wallets in 2020, Hardware wallets are 40 bucks. Hardware wallets are cheaper than most printers, and they cover the full life cycle of your crypto keys. They help you keep your crypto keys off unsafe computers by handling all the signing and processing of your crypto keys on the device itself, unlike a paper wallet.
