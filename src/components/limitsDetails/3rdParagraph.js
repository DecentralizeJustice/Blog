const paragraph3 =
`<p>At this tier our budget is zero so we have to use what we already have. A modern consumer computer is too large of an attack surface to be secure. Software wallets also give hackers a great scaling factor. They are able to simply hack one code base and steal the funds of everybody who uses that wallet. Software isn’t really good but it is the best that we have in this tier. A phone is better than a laptop since phones offer good sandboxing of apps. A consumer device isn’t created for security well, but it is better than having someone else hold your money, like an exchange or custodial wallet. Software on your machine might not be great, but it beats software on someone else's machine anyday. This tier is also about convenience. You can hold small amounts of money on your phone/computer and buy things with it. Much like someone would hold small amounts of  money in their wallet for daily spending. In this tier we are just waiting till 30% of our money can get us a hardware wallet.
