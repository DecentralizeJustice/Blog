`<p>This tier helps us distribute our keys in different locations, so that if one location is destroyed we still have access to our funds. This also is a great tier to start thinking about what will happen to our crypto when we die. You can leave keys with other people in case you die or your home is wiped out, you still have your crypto. The biggest danger in this tier would be physical attacks and that is why it is limited to 20,000 USD. 
There is no hardwallet or tech device that would protect you if someone wanted to kidnap you or a loved one and make you send them crypto. Or just beat you until you send them the money. Cryptography and hardware wallets can only go so far while humans are still the weakest link.
