`<p>This tier helps you distribute your keys in different locations, so that if one location is destroyed you still have access to our funds. 
This also is a great tier to start thinking about what will happen to your crypto when you die.

The biggest danger in this tier would be physical attacks and that is why it is limited to 20,000 USD. 
There is no hardware wallet or tech device that would protect you if someone wanted to kidnap you or a loved one and make you send them crypto. 
An motivated attacker could also simply perform a 5 dollar
