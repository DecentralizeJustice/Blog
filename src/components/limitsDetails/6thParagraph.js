const paragraph5 =
`<p>This tier helps you distribute your keys in different locations, so that if one location is destroyed you still have access to our funds. 
This also is a great tier to start thinking about what will happen to your crypto when you die. 
You can leave keys with other people in case you die or your home is wiped out, your crypto will still be accessible. 
The biggest danger in this tier would be physical attacks. 
There is no hardware wallet or tech device that would protect you if someone wanted to kidnap you or a loved one and make you send them crypto. 
An motivated attacker could also simply perform a 5 dollar 
<a href="https://xkcd.com/538/">wrench attack</a>
on you. Cryptography and hardware wallets can only go so far while humans are still the weakest link. So if you are storing large amounts of crypto,
you have to protect you and your loved ones. You should also not tell people how much crypto that you have, that will go a long way in protecting you 
at this tier.
