`<p>This step helps us bring our chances of a faulty crypto wallet causing us to lose our money down dramatically. 
If we use 3 different wallets, in order to lose our money 2 wallets have to be hacked by the same person. 
The chances of this happening are small due to the fact that it is a hard hack, and there are easier targets for hackers to go for. 
The minimum number of wallets is 2 of 3 to avoid hostage situations with our wallet. 
This setup protects us from hardware wallet hacks pretty well. Users can still make other mistakes, such as sending money to the wrong person, entering thier mnemonic seeds into a computer ,or some other user misuse. 
Although no hardware wallets have been hacked in the while, I still reccomend people get into this tier once they hit 1,000 dollars becuase I want to be on the safe side of history.
Although no attacks are documented in the wild, plenty of attacks exist in theory and

People will begin to attack hardware wallets in the wild, and you should invest in your security before you need it, because after you need it , it is usually too late.
At this tier our biggest danger is losing your keys to natural disasters such as a storm or flood. The next tier helps save your keys from natural disasters.
