`<p>This step helps us bring our chances of a faulty crypto wallet causing us to lose our money down dramatically. If we use 3 different wallets, in order to lose our money 2 wallets have to be hacked by the same person. The chances of this happening are small due to the fact that it is a hard hack, and there are easier targets to be had. The minui is 2 of 3 to avoid hostage situations with our wallet. This setup protects us from hardware wallet hacks pretty well. We can still make other mistakes, such as sending money to the wrong person, or entering your mnemonic seed into a computer or some other operational misuse. At this tier our biggest danger is losing our keys to natural disasters such as a storm or flood. The next tier helps save our keys from natural disasters.
