<p>Cryptography and computer security can be complicated, but the technical specifics of cryptographic security
can be abstracted away to a simple goal: Find a balance between the cost and reward to hack you and the cost of
 your security. Most hackers require an economic incentive to hack people. Very few hackers have venture capital
funding or government support to fund their profession and their efforts must be economical. If a hacker sees
that my system is very secure and would take 10 hours to hack, and that I likely have less than 100 dollars
of crypto on my computer they are not likely to hack me. If their hack was successful they would roughly be
making 10 dollars an hour, 3 dollars above the federal minimum wage and they would be risking going to prison
and fines. Any hacker that is rational would not dedicate time to hacking me. If we follow this incentive
based logic, we might use  all of our money on our security, but if we spend all of our money on security,
we won’t have anything to secure. So it’s about finding a balance. We don’t want to spend too little on
our security, that would be like spending a dollar to protect a hundred. And gives us a security budget
to protected amount ratio of 1%. The goal for most of the tiers is to stay somewhere in between 10% and 30%.
This ratio does not guarantee your money’s safety, but if you go below the 10% for most tiers you are decreasing your security
 ratio and not properly investing in your security. Neglecting your security investment might seem ok right up to the
 point that you loose your crypto. You should buy the best security setup that you can reasonably afford, and I believe 10% to 30% security ratio means you can reasonably afford said security.
Don’t lose a hundreds dollars trying to save a buck. Everybody will have their own bounds for their security ratio,
but I will not recommend anything beyond the bounds listed here for the safety of our readers.
Now that I am done exalting the importance of proper security investments(for now), lets dive into the security details of the Use Whatever You Have tier.
