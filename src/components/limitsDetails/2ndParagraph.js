<p>Cryptography and computer security can be complicated, but the technical specifics of cryptographic security can be abstracted away to a simple goal: Find a balance between the cost and reward to hack you and the cost of your security. Most hackers have an economic incentive to hack people. Very few hackers have venture capital funding or government support to fund their profession and their efforts must be economical. If a hacker sees that my system is very secure and would take 10 hours to hack, and that I likely have less than 100 dollars of crypto on my computer they are not likely to hack me. If their hack was successful they would roughly be making 10 dollars an hour, 3 dollars above the federal minimum wage and they would be risking going to prison and fines. Any hacker that reasonable would not dedicate time to hacking me. If we follow this incentive based logic, we might use  all of our money on our security, but if we spend all of our money on security, we won’t have anything to secure. So it’s about finding a balance. We don’t want to spend too little on our security, that would be like spending a dollar to protect a hundred. And gives us a security budget to protected amount ratio of 1%. The goal for most of the tiers is to stay somewhere in between 10% and 30%. This ratio does not guarantee your money’s safety, but if you go below the 10% for most tiers you are decreasing your security ratio unreasonably so and increasing your risk of loss, all to save a few bucks. Don’t lose a thousand dollars trying to save a buck. Everybody will have their own bounds for their security ratio, but I will not recommend anything beyond what are listed here.
