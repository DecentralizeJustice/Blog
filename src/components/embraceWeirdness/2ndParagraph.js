` <p>
  Innovative technology is weird because humans are weird. There is no way to predict the path that these technologies
 might take. For example, If i tried
  to convince a person from 2001 that the reality TV star Donald Trump would become president and use the internet as
  a platform to argue with Snoop Dog ,the gangster rapper, and Madonna ,the pop star, then they would most likely
  laugh in my face. People are weird and technology is weird. This weirdness means that the future is almost impossible to predict. We can't
  simply draw from past technologies to learn about the future. If we try and do this we will limit ourselves
  and risk sounding like the driver from ealier when these innovative technlogies are used commonly.
   Instead we should embrace this weirdness and unfamiliarity with a broad imagination and many questions. </p>

  It should be clear by now  that comparing innovative technologies to old technlogies isn’t the best thing to do, but people
  do this all the time with cryptocurrencies.
  We have all seen articles that compare bitcoin and cash. These articles usually compare things like
  security or transaction speed and volume and come to the conclusion that cryptocurrencies will never be that big because
  they don’t really compare to the current money that we have now. These people tend to make the mistake of comparing innovative technologies
  to past technologies. Instead of focusing on how cash is similar to bitcoin, it would be more enriching to focus on how they are different
  and the possibilities that exist in this differnce.`
