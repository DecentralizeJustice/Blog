`<p>We should focus on how weird bitcoin and ethereum is compared to old tech and how
  they will be different in the future, when compared to old tech. It is almost impossible to try and predict the specifics
  of future technologies, but we can imagine what they might look like. The process of imagining instead of
  predicting the future, unburdens us from having to be right and looking to history to support our statements.
  Imagining instead allows us to explore infinite possibilites, granting us the complete freedom to dream. These dreams
  may be weird and unfamiliar, and they should be.
We should embrace the weirdness of these new ideas and allow them to expand our understanding of the future and
ourselves, instead of trying to fit cryptocurrencies into our current
understanding of the world. We owe cryptocurrencies and ourselves the freedom to imagine.</p>

I want us to have more weird and imaginative conversations and less conversations focusing on the relatively mundane advancements.
There are a million articles about how cryptocurrencies will
make moving money faster, but very few on how decentralized organizations will change what it means to be human or how a
microtransaction focused economy could be a more equitable
 way to distribute value. These types of conversations exist in certain communties and contexts,
  such as futurist writings and queer theory, but I hope that we can have more imaginative and unbound
  conversations everday.  We should let go of the past and  stop trying to predict the future.
  We need to dream and imagine bigger things because the only
  thing that truly limits our future is our collective
  imagination about what the future could be.`
