would  hopefully be your answer. You should say no because your driver
probably isn't good at drvivng.This is because they made a connections and skills based on similarities that don’t really matter.
In this example it is comically clear that this driver does
not understand how to drive well. Cars and bikes share some similarities, but cars
 were an innovative technology compared to bikes,
so drawing similarities between the two technologies isn’t really useful and can be dangerous. 
When I made this mistake,but with cryptocurrencies, it wasn't as comical or dangerous though.</p>

When I first started learning about cryptocurrencies I wanted to understand everything about them.
I wanted to know what types there were,how they worked, how I could get involved, and most importantly,
what they would look like in the future. In order to learn about the
future of  cryptocurrencies, I decided to look to the past for guidance and since the internet and
cryptocurrencies seemed similar I decided
to study the history of the internet in order to learn more about how cryptocurrencies might grow
and evolve in the future. At the time
this made perfect sense to me, since we are taught that history is a great tool for learning about the
future. This didn’t really help me
learn anything about cryptocurrencies, although the history of the internet is a great thing to know about.
My mistake was years ago, and
I know why my plan to predict the
future of crypto didn't work; Drawing similarities between innovative technologies doesn't work because
of the weird nature humanity and innovation.`
