    would have hopefully been your answer. You would say no because your driver
    made a connection based on similarities that don’t really matter. In this example it is clear and comical that this person does
    not understand how to drive well. Cars and bikes share some similarities, but cars were an innovative technology compared to bikes,
    so drawing similarities between the two technologies isn’t really useful, and can be dangerous.</p>

    <p>When I first started learning about cryptocurrencies I wanted to understand everything about them. I wanted to know what types they were,
     how they worked, how I could get involved, and most importantly, what they would look like in the future. In order to learn about the
     future of  cryptocurrencies, I decided to look to the past for guidance and since the internet and cryptocurrencies seemed similar I decided
      to study the history of the internet in order to learn more about how cryptocurrencies might grow and evolve in the future. At the time
      this made perfect sense to me, since were taught that history is a great tool for learning about the future. This didn’t really help me
      learn anything about cryptocurrencies(although it is a great thing to know about). That was years ago, and I know why my plan to predict the
      future of crypto didn't work; Drawing similarities between innovative technologies doesn't  work because of the nature of innovation.</p>

     Hubris combined with focusing on how two technologies are similar can cost you to get into an accident, such as the case with a car vs
      a bicycle  or to miss out on some beautiful and life changing opportunities because technology is weird and unpredictable.

      If what I say now seems to be very reasonable, then I will have failed completely.
       Only if what I tell appears absolutely unreasonable have we any chance of visualizing
       the future as it really will happen. <br>  - Arthur C. Clarke

      Innovative technology is weird because humans are weird. There is no way to predict the path that these technologies
     might take. Arthur C. Clarke was a futurist known for co-writing the screenplay for 2001: A Space Odyssey .
     They firmly believed that the future would be an absurd place to people living in the past. For example, If i tried
      to convince a person from 2000 that the reality tv star Donal Trump would become president and use the internet as
      a platform to argue with Snoop Dog, the gangster rapper, and Madonna , the pop star, then they would most likely
      laugh in my face. In fact the Simpsons actually made an episode where trump was president, as a joke. People are
      weird and technology is weird. This weirdness means that the future is almost impossible to predict. We can't
      simply draw from past technologies to learn about the future. If we try and do this we will limit ourselves and
       instead we should embrace this weirdness and unfamiliarity. </p>

      It should be clear by now to you that comparing innovative technologies isn’t the best thing to do, but people
      do this all the time with cryptocurrencies.
      We have all seen articles stating that compare bitcoin and cash. These articles usually compare things like
      security or transaction speed and volume and come to the conclusion that cryptocurrencies will never be that big because
      they don’t really compare to the current money that we have now. These people tend to make the mistake of comparing innovative technologies
      to past technologies. Instead of focusing on how cash is similar to bitcoin, it would be more enriching to focus on how they are different.

    <p>We should focus on how weird bitcoin and ethereum is compared to old technologies and how it will be different in the future compared to historical technologies.
    We should embrace this weirdness and allow it to expand our understanding of the future and ourselves, instead of trying to fit cryptocurrencies into our current
    understanding of the world, which are  often based upon the past.</p>

    I want us to have more weird conversations, less conversations focusing on the mundane and archaic. There are a million articles about how cryptocurrencies will
    change the fin tech industries, but very few on how dao’s will change what it means to be human or how a microtransaction based economy could be a more equitable
     one. These types of conversations exist in certain communties and contexts, such as futurist writings and queer theory, but I hope that we can incorporate them
      into our everyday conversations more. We need to dream and imagine bigger things because the only things that truly limit our future is our collective
      imagination about what it could be.
